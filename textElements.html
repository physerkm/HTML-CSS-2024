    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em>. These are the language
      of the web.

    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why we too should learn it.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language
      that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
      (not a programming language).

    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      Paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
