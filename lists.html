    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>In HTML, each element consists of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Why should we learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
      web. Here are 5 of them
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Foundation of Web Development:</strong> HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript are the building blocks of web pages. Learning these allows
        you to create, style, and add interactivity to websites, giving you
        control over how content appears and functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In-Demand Skill for Jobs:</strong> Front-end development skills
        are highly sought after. Many positions, even outside traditional web
        development, require a basic understanding of these languages to work
        effectively on web-based platforms or collaborate with development
        teams.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Versatility Across Fields:</strong> Knowing HTML and CSS is not
        limited to web development; it's useful in fields like digital
        marketing, content creation, and technical documentation. Basic web
        skills can be valuable across various industries.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quick and Easy to Learn:</strong> HTML and CSS are relatively
        easy to pick up, especially for beginners. They provide instant visual
        feedback, which makes learning engaging and encourages experimentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gateway to Advanced Programming:</strong>Mastering the
        fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can make it easier to learn
        more advanced languages and frameworks. They build a foundational
        understanding of programming logic, syntax, and structure that applies
        across coding languages and disciplines.
