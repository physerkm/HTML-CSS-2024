In HTML, when we talk about semantics, what we mean is that certain elements have actually a meaning or a purpose attached to them.

So when we think about a certain HTML element, we should actually not think about what that element looks like as it's rendered on the page.

But instead, we should think about what element actually means and what it stands for.

That is basically the definition of semantic HTML.

Not all elements in HTML are semantic.

Why do we actually write semantic HTML?
- Search engine optimization (SEO)
- Accessibility, especially for people who rely on screen readers to consume our webpages.
